<h3>Information</h3>

* Working experiment code in experiment_draft.html

* This study seeks to explore how disclosure of artificial intelligence (AI) involvement in the creation of media influences audience perception.
* Specifically, it investigates whether labelling a silent film clip as 'AI-generated' versus 'Human-generated' alters how viewers rate its aesthetic quality, how emotional the clip is, and its familiarity - even when the clips are all created by human filmmakers.
* The research aims to examine not only the impact of labelling on film consumers but also whether professional expertise in the media industry moderates or amplifies this effect, by including media professionals in the study.
